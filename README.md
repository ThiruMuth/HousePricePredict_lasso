# HousePricePredict_lasso
This is my 2nd academic project while learning on various types of linear models. This model is built on lasso with the data available from machinehack house price hackathon challenge. The best possible option may be Random Forest regression as suggested in the hackathon description as the pair plots did not show very strong relationship with the price except for the square feet, that too < 50%
